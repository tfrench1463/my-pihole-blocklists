# my-pihole-blocklists

Create custom [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) [blocklists](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/wiki/Customising-sources-for-ad-lists#block-more-than-advertisements) to block unwanted traffic to a network.

### Disclaimer
*This project is in **no way** affiliated with the core Pi-Hole project or organization. This project was created as a contribution to the community by providing high quality blocklists. Use at your own risk.*

## Screenshots
Pi-hole dashboard with the default, light, and heavy porn blocklists installed;

## Supported lists

Currently supported lists;
1. porn (via `create_blocklist_porn.pl` which creates two lists)<br />
... **light list**: `pi_blocklist_porn_top1m.list` (~21k domains). This list is a correlated list to only block porn sites that appear on Alex'a top 1m site list.<br />
... **heavy list**: `pi_blocklist_porn_all.list` (~2m domains). This list is a slightly edited list from Université Toulouse 1 Capitole.  _NOTE: Use caution when using this list with embedded computers._<br />
2. more coming soon...

## Requirements
* Perl
* Array::Utils (install via `sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'install Array::Utils'` aslo you may needed to use `export PERL5LIB=` after installing Array::Utils to add path to the library)

## Installation
1. SSH to deployed pi-hole
2. Copy adlists.default to adlists.list `sudo cp /etc/pihole/adlists.default /etc/pihole/adlists.list`
3. Edit `sudo vi /etc/pihole/adlists.list` to add one of the following lists;<br />
... **Light**: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chadmayfield/pihole-blocklists/master/lists/pi_blocklist_porn_top1m.list`<br />
... **Heavy** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chadmayfield/pihole-blocklists/master/lists/pi_blocklist_porn_all.list`<br />
4. Run `pihole -g` to update all lists
```

**NOTE**: This is a work in progress and is being actively developed (for now).

## TODO
- [ ] Cleanup the code! (most of this was written as PoC)
- [ ] Log output from script to file rather than STDOUT
- [X] Add comparison to Alexa top 1 million sites to only block the top sites
- [ ] Add cron script to run from cron daily/weekly/monthly
- [ ] Add installation script for automated install
- [ ] Add additional lists to combine into one mega list
- [ ] Possibly generizie script to accept any list
- [ ] Add instructions to host the list on the pi-host itself
- [ ] Add the Cisco Umbrella OpenDNS Top 1 Million list
- [ ] Add the Majestic Million list
- [ ] Add the Stavoo Top 1 Million list
